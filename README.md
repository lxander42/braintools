# The Information Manager for your Online Life

### Now with Bookmark Exchange and improved Tree editing!

**Praise from users and the press:**
- "Bring your bookmarks into the 21st century"
- "Every Google Chrome user should try this"
    - [Kingsley-Hughes @ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-google-chrome-user-should-try-this/)
- "As a current Tabs Outliner user, my first reaction is that BrainTool, even in its pre-1.0 release, is far more polished."
- "I've used Session Buddy and OneTab. This is far superior."
- "Behind the simplicity is a lot of power."
- "Gave bookmarks the performance and usability boost that I'd been waiting for all these years"

Increasingly all the things you need to keep track of have a URL and you access them inside a browser. That's why you always have five windows open with 23 tabs each - they're so small you can't even tell them apart! 

With BrainTool you can save and link all your online information sources (web sites, Google docs, gmails, files, photos, Slack channels, social media groups, code repos, wiki pages, task backlogs, Jupyter notebooks, etc etc etc) and then see them organized in the BrainTool SidePanel, along with your annotations and notes. 

<table style="border:none;">
<tr>
<td style="border:none; vertical-align:top; padding-left:0px; padding-top: 50px;">
The BrainTool side panel shows your nested Topic hierarchy. A topic is a category that groups web pages you want to organize and remember. On the screenshot right you can see open tabs and Chrome windows are shown highlighted and <b>TODO</b> items are indicated in <b>bold</b>. In this example I have an open Chrome window showing the 'Kitchen Project' topic, it has the Crown Point Cabinetry site open. I also have Personal TODO to try a meditation practice thats linked but not open in a window anywhere.

To save a page just takes three or four keystrokes with built-in auto-complete. Click the BrainTool icon, or use Option-b, and just start typing.

<tr>
<td style="border:none; padding-left:0px;">
Optionally add short or detailed notes to give context, aid recall or capture why the page is of interest; or just hit Enter to tear off the tab and save it with its topic-mates.
<br/><br/>Pop (pull torn-off tab and its window to the top), Hide (don't pop) and Close, support different organizational workflows.

Open, Close and Control all pages by tag with a single click in the side panel. Great for switching between tasks and projects and keeping your work-space clean!
<br/><br/>
Drag and drop to reorder the hierarchy at will. Mark pages as TODO/DONE, ToRead or create your own tags and process.

All your data is stored on your Google Drive in a plain text file that can be separately edited, backed-up or shared. Everything is kept securely within your Google ecosystem and nowhere else. Your BrainTool file is structured as an [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) file. If you are an orgmode user, or just a plain text note taker, the file is fully editable and can be synced with the extension. The BrainTool panel in Chrome uses the org-mode tree structure but concentrates on the links within your notes thus unifying two primary ways to capture information.
